# IMM-DOS NX
The next iteration of an experimental DOS-compatible OS.

IMM-DOS was an experiment in building a DOS clone: a real-mode OS for x86 processors that implemented the DOS API and imitated many of its behaviors. NX takes it a step further, implementing a protected-mode OS that runs real-mode DOS programs in Virtual 8086 environments.
